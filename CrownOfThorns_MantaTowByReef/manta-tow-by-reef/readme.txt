REEF_NAME:	The reef name as shown in the Great Barrier Reef Gazetteer.
REEF_ID:	Unique Identifier assigned to each reef
LATITUDE:	Latitude of reef site in decimal degrees
LONIGITUDE:	Longitude of reef site in decimal degrees
P_CODE:		For AIMS Use: RM – data collected under LTMP program 
		RAP – data collected under Representative Areas Program (since 2006)
		RMRAP- data collected under both LTMP and RAP programs 
VISIT_NUMBER:	Indicates the number of years the program had been running for each reporting year (program commenced in 1992)
YEAR_CODE:	Indicated the year period in which the trip occurred, in YYYY(1)-YY(2) format, i.e. for 199293, ‘1992’ is YYYY(1), and 93 is YY(2) referencing 1993.

REPORT_YEAR:	Year in which the report was issued, YYYY
SAMPLE_DATE:	The date the survey took place in DD-MM-YYYY

MEDIAN_LIVE_CORAL:	Median value of the reef’s categorical percentage cover estimate for live coral cover for the survey year. Recorded as one of 6 categories, see table 5 below. Note where ‘U’ or ‘L’ have been used, this translates to ‘+’ (U) and ‘-‘ (L) values, i.e. being upper and lower categories. 

MEDIAN_SOFT_CORAL:	Median value of the reef’s categorical percentage cover estimate for soft coral cover for the survey year.
Recorded as one of 11 categories, see table 5 below.  

MEDIAN_DEAD_CORAL:	Median value of the reef’s percentage cover estimate for dead coral cover for the survey year.
Recorded as one of 11 categories, see table 5 below. 

MEAN_LIVE_CORAL:	Average value of reef’s percentage cover estimate for live coral cover.
MEAN_SOFT_CORAL:	Average value of reef’s percentage cover estimate for live coral cover.
MEAN_DEAD_CORAL:	Average value of reef’s percentage cover estimate for dead coral cover.
TOTAL_COTS:		Total count of COTS observed in the total tows for the reef 
MEAN_COTS_PER_TOW:	Average of COTS per tow, from columns TOTAL_COTS / TOWS
TOTAL_TROUT:		Total number of coral trout (Plectropomus spp., Gracila sp. and Variola spp) seen in the total survey tows for the reef.
MEAN_TROUT_PER_TOW:	Average number of coral trouts seen per tows on the reef.
TOWS:			Number of two minute survey tows completed on the reef on the sample date.
